Innomad brand style for AI & technology — modular vector system diagrams

## Design Aesthetic

Flat vector illustration with node-and-connection system diagram language. Modular rounded rectangles connected by data flow lines. Simplifies complex technical concepts into clear, approachable visual modules. Vector-illustration influenced but with a structured, systematic layout approach.

## Background

- Color: Cream Off-White (#F5F0E6)
- Texture: Subtle paper texture, warm nostalgic feel

## Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| Background | Cream Off-White | #F5F0E6 | Primary background |
| Brand Anchor | Navy Ink | #1E3A5F | Outlines, titles, brand consistency |
| AI Primary | Indigo | #6366F1 | AI/model elements, primary modules |
| Data Flow | Cyan | #06B6D4 | Connections, data streams, links |
| AI Secondary | Violet | #8B5CF6 | Secondary AI elements, sub-modules |
| Success | Teal Green | #14B8A6 | Output, success states, results |
| Text | Charcoal | #2D2D2D | Body text, labels |

## Visual Elements

- Rounded rectangle modules with consistent border radius
- Directional arrows with arrowheads showing data flow
- Terminal window icons (title bar with 3 dots)
- Gear and API plug icons for integration points
- Neural network node clusters (circles + connections)
- Uniform-thickness outlines on all elements (coloring book style)
- Layered depth through overlap, no 3D
- Code bracket decorative elements ({ })

## Style Rules

### Do

- Abstract concepts into concrete visual modules
- Use connection lines to show relationships and data flow
- Maintain consistent outline thickness across all elements
- Simplify complex systems into clear node graphs
- Keep Navy Ink for all titles and primary outlines

### Don't

- Use dark/cyberpunk color schemes
- Add 3D rendering or realistic shading
- Use meaningless decorative elements
- Vary line weights inconsistently
- Create corporate PPT aesthetic

## Best For

AI tools and tutorials, LLM explainers, system architecture, technical workflows, API documentation, programming concepts, automation pipelines
